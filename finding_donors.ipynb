    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* If we chose a model that always predicted an individual made more than $50,000, what would  that model's accuracy and F-score be on this dataset? You must use the code cell below and assign your results to `'accuracy'` and `'fscore'` to be used later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",
    "* Our Recall score(True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)) in this setting becomes 1 as we have no False Negatives."

    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "`Decision Trees can also take a lot of memory if there is a great depth of tree in case of many parameters that could lead to complexity and difficulty in testing new parameters which could lead to overfitting`\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "` Since there are not as many decisions or categories in the dataset, it is ideal to go for this model, also considering it is great for binary decisions which is the purpose of our problem. `\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Random Forest Classification Model\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "` Random forest is a choice for multi-class classification like predicting patients for high risks, parts failures in manufacturing, loan defaulters etc`\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "`High accuracy model that is specially helpful when you don't want to tend to overfit. Since Single trees like Decision tree models are used very rarely, in composition with many others Random forest model is an efficient way to train, test and predict data`\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "`With Random Forest however, learning may be slow (depending on the parameterization) and it is not possible to iteratively improve the generated models`\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "`In this case, there are multiple classes like occupation, work class so classification of data by these classes can be done efficiently using this model as compared to Decision tree model which may tend to overfit the data`\n",

    "3) ADA Boost\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "`AdaBoost is designed for binary classification (two output classes) and makes use of decision trees. It can be used to solve a variety of real-world problems, such as predicting customer churn and classifying the types of topics customers are talking/calling about`\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "`High accuracy. AdaBoost can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm. It is best used with weak learners. These are models that achieve accuracy just above random chance on a classification problem.`\n",

    "`High complexity. AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms.`\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "`Since Decision tree alogirithm is used for this problem, which provides higher interpretability and RAndom forest gives a quick analysis without making the model too complex, one other model we can test this problem with is ADA boost which has very high accuracy but low interpretatbility, but it may be complex in nature.`\n",

    "- ` Training and prediction time based determination` - Since it is not that complex a dataset, training times wouldn't be that high an impact. However, for ADA boost, the training time is 1.5 secs, 0.06 secs prediction time vs 0.53 sec training time, 0.03 sec prediction time for RAndom forest model vs 0.46 sec training time, 0.09 sec prediction time for Decision Tree model, which doesn't make sense to go for ADA boost model since it is a lot higher.\n",

    "- Random Forest is preferred model owing to the need to have a good performing model as a standard, while making sure the model built is not specifically applicable only to current data, but making sure it is flexible enough to iterate and apply the existing pattern with minor tweaking to new data as CharityML is expanded to new set of users with new data points added.\n",
    "- Since there are a certain factors like occupation, age, education etc that could help determine the correct classification of people by their income segment, there is a possibility of new parameters that could be added like income fluctations, inflation, salary hike, retirement and other factors (as example) that could impact the classification of people and move them from >50K income to <=50K income and vice versa\n",
    "- In such cases, Decision tree model is very rigid and accustomed to predict classification only based on pattern determined by the current model training, and hence, even if the learning is gradual (as compared to decision tree model) owing to larger training times, Random forest model is an effective model that gives quick analysis while providing good accuracy in predicting the income classification even with addition of new parameters.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "- `hours per week` - If a person works on an hourly basis as contractor Or full time vs part time, he/she is expected to get higher income\n",
    "- `Occupation` - A skilled job like in the field of IT or Goverment agency has higher income offering than an administrative clerk\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- The common feature overlap between the manual prediction vs systematic prediction (as shown in the group above) are a) MArital status b) Education num c) hours-per-week since a) Marital staus indicates if you are single OR with family etc that pplays important role in the total household income, planning to get extra income etc b) education level determines the qualification which has direct relation on income c) hours -per-week of work determines high impact on total income for people who work on a contracting/ hourly basis\n",
    "- Capital gain and relationship were initially not thought to have as much impact, but are determined so from the results\n",
    "- The other reasons i had gone with selecting Occupation and age because the type of job could have high relationship on salary ex: if you are working in IT, there is more likelyhood of having higher income vs working as an admin clerk. Similarly, experience was thought to have higher co-relationship with higher income, but that is not necessarily true as was determined in the graph result. In few cases, working in IT sector, higher experience could possibly indicate higher income, but since there are various occupations, skill level and age are not very highly co-related as was determined by the graph results"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
